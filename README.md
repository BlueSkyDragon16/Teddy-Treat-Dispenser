# Teddy Treat Dispenser

## Why did I make this?
Upon heading to university, we observed our dog becoming uneasy, often resting outside my room. Recognizing this, I devised a treat dispenser for him whenever he lingered at my door. After he accidentally damaged the sensor, I modified it to function on a timer. Now, the dispenser delivers treats to soothe him during prolonged waits. In a recent upgrade, I connected the treat dispenser to a website, allowing me to control it from anywhere globally. This not only ensures my dog receives treats at his whim but also adds a layer of convenience for me, offering the ability to pamper him even when I'm far away. It's a delightful solution that brings comfort to my furry friend and a touch of innovation to our daily routine.

## Future Plans

Considerations for future enhancements:
1.) Add it to my [Website](https://www.zephsuderman.ca)

## Code 
As a non-computer science student, understanding the intricacies of the codeâ€™s functionality is challenging. Extensive YouTube tutorials were consulted for implementation. There might be simpler approaches, and I welcome suggestions for improvement.
